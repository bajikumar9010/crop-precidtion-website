   <center><h1><strong>Types Of Pesticides Used In Farming – Importance And Benefits</strong></h1></center> 
   <br>
   <p><b>Pesticide is a chemical-based substance to repel, control, and kill animal life or plant life, known as pests. They include a range of biological agents such as disinfectants, antimicrobials, bacteria, and viruses to control agricultural pests that can damage crops and livestock. While pests can involve fungi, rodents, slugs, insects, weeds, snails, bird mites, etc.</b></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p>Pesticides are the greatest innovation that saves farmers hard-earned productivity and efforts while cultivating. Moreover, they help protect crops and land from uninvited organisms or plants that leach all the nutrients of crops.</p>
<br><b><ul>
    <li>Pesticides help control pests that can cause plant-based diseases.</li>
    <li>It avoids the inhibition of organisms that can cause human/livestock diseases.</li>
    <li>It helps control organisms that can disrupt human activities and structures.</li>
</ul></b>
<br>
<center><h2><strong>1.More output with lesser land</strong></h2></center>
<p>Pesticides have been helping farmers use the land to grow more crops which increases productivity by 20-50%. Moreover, pesticides help farmers gain more benefits from inputs such as high-quality seeds, tools, fertilizers, nutrients, and other water resources. Also, pesticides help sustain high-quality crop production in lesser and limited lands.</p>
<br>
<center><h2><strong> 2.Control waterborne transmission & insect-transmitted diseases</strong></h1></center>
<p>Since pesticides kill all varieties of pests in crops, land, and soil, the outbreak of harmful water borne or insect-based diseases gets eliminated. </p>
<br>
<center><h2><strong>3.Pesticides help save the environment</strong></h2></center>
<p>Pesticides allow lands to cultivate more crops/area with less tillage, which keeps soil erosion, deforestation, and natural resources in check. Also, it helps keep vicious weeds and plant species at bay.</p>
<center><h2>4.Different Types of Pesticides Used in Agriculture Commonly</h2></center>

<p>Pesticides can be categorised into different types based on their purpose or the type of pests they are targeting. Let’s discuss the type and name of pesticides:</p>
<br>
<center><h2><strong>Herbicides</strong></h2></center>
<p>Herbicides prevent the growth of weeds that can leach the nutrients required by the crops for growing. <br><br>
    <i>Furthermore, 2,4-D, Clethodim, Glyphosate, Bentazon, and Clethodim are a few types of pesticides which are a part of herbicides in agriculture. </i>
</p>
<center><h2><strong>Insecticides</strong></h2></center>
<p>As the name suggests, insecticides attack the nervous system of insects to restrict their inhibition or breeding. <br><br>
    <i>Organophosphate, Carbamates, Nicotinoids, Fumigants, and Biorational are a few types of pesticides used as insecticides.</i>
</p>
<center><h2><strong>Fungicides</strong></h2></center>
<p>Fungicides help prevent fungi’s growth and help remove them completely. Also, they can easily decay in the soil in the presence of air. <br><br>
    <i>Maneb, nabam, and cycloheximide are a few types of pesticides used as fungicides. </i>
</p>
<center><h2><strong>Rodenticides </strong></h2></center>
<p>They are chemical substances used to control the inhabitation of rodents such as rats, mice, gophers, and even fish, birds, and mammals that can destroy crops. <br><br>
<i>Moreover, Chlorophacinone, diphacinone, brodifacoum, and bromadiolone are a few examples of rodenticides. </i></p>
<center><h2><strong>Larvicides</strong></h2></center>
<p>Larvicides are pesticides that control or restrict larvae or mosquito growth or restart their breeding to prevent vector-borne diseases like malaria.</p>
<br>
<center><h2><strong>Molluscicides</strong></h2></center>
<p>Pesticides that typically restrict the inhabitation or spreading of molluscs such as snails, slugs and others.</p>
<br><br>
<center><h2><strong>Bactericides</strong></h2></center>
<p>Pesticides kill or restrict the spreading of harmful bacteria throughout crops and livestock.</p>
<br>
<center><h2><strong>Algaecides</strong></h2></center>
<p>These pesticides kill or restrict the growth of algae for better crop yield. <br><br>
     <i>Moreover, now we have a list of pesticides and their uses, let’s venture into biodegradable and persistent pesticide types.</i></p>
