    <h1><strong>Crops of ANDHRA PRADESH  AND TELANGANA</strong></h1></center>
    <br>
    <p>Andhra Pradesh, in the southeast of India, has a robust agricultural economy. Agriculture is crucial to the state's economy since it provides jobs for a large percentage of the people, ensures a steady supply of affordable food, and helps rejuvenate rural areas. A wide variety of crops and agricultural practices are well-suited to the region's fertile terrain, diverse climate, and advanced irrigation infrastructure. Andhra Pradesh has become an important role in India's agricultural scene owing to its long history of farming and its adoption of progressive farming practices. Readers can also head to our Andhra Pradesh GK page for more such topics to help with their exam preparations.</p>
    Telangana state has considered agriculture as its primary goal to improve farmer community wellness, 
    educate on latest technical farming knowledge, train framers to boost the agricultural production and productivity. 
    In three major zones namely, Northern Zone, Central Zone and Southern Zone.Crops that are grown in Telangana are Rice, 
    Maize/ Corn, Red Gram, Green Gram, Jowar, Sesame, Castor, Cotton, Groundnut, Soyabean , Black Gram to mention a few.</p>

        <h1>Red Gram</h1>
        <br>Red gram is commonly known as Tur or Arhar (Pigeon pea) in India and is the second important pulse in the country after gram (chana). The ability of red gram to produce high economic yields under soil moisture deficit makes it an important crop in rain fed and dry land agriculture. Redgram is an important rain fed crop in the state of Andhra Pradesh cultivated in 2,40,000 ha. Main growing season is kharif. It is an integral component of various cropping systems and is grown sole or as an intercrop with groundnut, millets, cotton and other pulses. It is consumed on a very large scale in South Asia and is a major source of protein for the population of the Indian subcontinent. It is the primary accompaniment to rice or roti and has the status of staple diet throughout the length and breadth of India.

        <br>Black gram (Vigna Mungo L.), is one of the important pulses crop, grown throughout the country. The crop is resistant to adverse climatic conditions and improve the soil fertility by fixing atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. It has been reported that the crop produces equivalent to 22.10 kg of N/ha., which has been estimated to be supplement of 59 thousand tonnes of urea annually. It is generally grown in kharif/rainy and summer season.It grows best in hot and humid condition with ideal temperature range between 25 to 35oC. Black gram does well on heavier soils such as black cotton soils which retain moisture better The pulse 'Black gram' plays an important role in Indian diet, as it contains vegetable protein and supplement to cereal based diet. It contains about 26% protein, which is almost three times that of cereals and other minerals and vitamins. Besides, it is also used as nutritive fodder, specially for milch animals. Black gram does well on heavier soils such as black cotton soils which retain moisture better Area under Blackgram cultivation in Andhra Pradesh was 3.18 lakh ha.Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh are major black gram growing states.  <a href="https://apseeds.ap.gov.in/Website/Blackgram.aspx" target="_blank">Read More..</a></div>

The Indian varieties of castor seeds have an oil content of 48% and up to 42% can be extracted, while its cake retains the rest. It is a perennial crop, harvested from March to June depending on its sowing time which corresponds with the monsoon rains in the Kharif season from June to August and in different regions. It is mainly cultivated under rain-fed conditions in semi-arid zones. That may be a reason that its historical yield is about 8-10 quintals per acre but after 3-4 irrigations, at the time of growth and fruiting time, farmers have obtained a yield of about 20-25 quintals per acre. In India; it is mainly cultivated in the states of Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Rajasthan, etc. <a href="https://oilseeds.dac.gov.in/Castor.aspx" target="_blank">Read More..</a></div>
